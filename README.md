# GMMK Pro Custom Keymap

This repository contains a custom keymap for the GMMK Pro keyboard, modified from the [2Manchu/gmmk-pro-qmk](https://github.com/2Manchu/gmmk-pro-qmk) QMK firmware.

## Overview
The keymap file (`keymap.c` or specify filename) is tailored for my personal use, based on 2Manchu's QMK configuration for the GMMK Pro. It includes customizations such as [briefly describe your changes, e.g., "remapped keys for gaming, added RGB controls, or optimized for macOS"].

## Modifications
- [Change 1, e.g., "Swapped Caps Lock with Left Control for better ergonomics."]
- [Change 2, e.g., "Added a layer for media controls on Fn + number row."]
- [Add more as needed.]

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the keymap file.
2. Place the keymap file in the appropriate directory of your QMK firmware fork (e.g., `qmk_firmware/keyboards/gmmk/pro/keymaps/your_keymap_name`).
3. Compile and flash the firmware using QMK Toolbox or `qmk compile` and `qmk flash`. Refer to the [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/) for detailed instructions.
4. Ensure your GMMK Pro is in DFU mode (e.g., press `Fn + \` for 2Manchu’s firmware) before flashing.
